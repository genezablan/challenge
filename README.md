  { first_name: 'Tatsaya', points: null, gender: 'female' },
  { first_name: 'Danyong', points: 20, gender: 'male' },
  { first_name: 'Elland', points: 15, gender: 'female' },
] 

1) Create a function that has a parameter of gender of the user, if the parameter is male the function would return an array of all male users. The array is sorted by the number of points from the lowest to the highest point.

2) Create a function that will convert the returned array to comma separated string.
for e.i. [a,b,c] ==> a,b,c
